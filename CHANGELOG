Dec 10 DEVEL_0_9_4_PRE5

  * Again tweaked with status handling. The flag bits are now reset before
    the status in a round is determined. When an ALERT status is demoted
    to a warning, the flags will be clear. The previous system didn't work
    out the way it should when there were multiple flags involved in
    more complex alert-wobbling.
    
  * Added a new tool n2pgrep, which allows you to search through a database
    file using specific criteria.

Dec  7 DEVEL_0_9_4_PRE4

  * Fixed glaring bug in n2encoding of strings (obi-one on offset, why did
    this ever work at all?).

  * Some more general output tweaking.

  * The data decoding now keeps an error string that n2hstat will print.

Dec  6 DEVEL_0_9_4_PRE3

  * n2groups human readable output now is a bit more distinctive for hosts
    in ST_DEAD.

Dec  5 DEVEL_0_9_4_PRE2

  * Added a commandline utility 'n2conftool'. As its arguments it expects
    configuration commands. These are applied against /etc/n2/n2rxd.conf,
    with the merged data stored back in the same location. This makes it
    easier for external programs (like cish scripts) to manipulate the
    configuration file.

Dec  2 DEVEL_0_9_4_PRE1

  * Cleaned up status handling and logging a bit more, I've been seeing
    some inconsistencies (where a host had a current status that didn't
    match with the available log data), but I can't find a code path
    that would lead to missing an update. Added some assertions.

  * Fixed status recognition bug in n2group, it didn't grok ST_DEAD as an
    alert status, plus it didn't dismiss the flag bits. All of this only
    in the 'csv' export mode used by the cish2 scripts. The output of
    'sho group' now makes more sense.

  * Added utmp entries to the packet format, stats now include a list
    of logged in users, their tty and their ip address.

Dec  1 RELEASE_0_9_3_1

  * Some improvements to the n2hstat output (more compact layout for a
    number of items).

  * The packet encoding format now recognizes redundant string constants
    and replaces reoccuring strings inside the packet by a 2-byte reference
    to the first instance.

  * When coding the top processes, up to 8 entries are now potentially
    stuffed into the packet (space at the end is reserved for the
    tcp port statistics).

  * Handling of status and status changes somewhat more sensible.

Dec  1 DEVEL_0_9_3_PRE2

  * On startup, n2txd will now assume responsibility for all hosts it can
    find records for in /var/state/n2/current, instead of only picking up
    hosts that are sending packets.

  * Strings are, if possible, compressed to a 6-bit character set before
    crossing the wire. Strings that have this property will have bit7 of
    their length field set. The other 7 bits in length indicate the size
    of the resulting string, not the data. Saves some space, so that
    some fields can be longer (specifically the hostname and mountpoints
    were sort of a problem).

Nov 30 DEVEL_0_9_3_PRE1

  * Upped the frequency in n2txd a bit.

  * One in every four packets is re-sent by n2txd, further mitigating
    hosts growing stale with minor packetloss.

  * Fixed proper detection of re-sent packets in n2rxd.

  * Added extra status watching for cpu%, ram, swap, netin, netout.

  * Added 'default foo-warning' and 'default foo-alert' configuration
    options to n2rxd.conf.

Nov 28 RELEASE_0_9_2_1

  * Minor output tweaks, add changelog.

Nov 28 DEVEL_0_9_2_PRE3

  * The upper 4 bits of status flag now contain the measurements responsible
    for a warning/alert state (out of rtt,loss,load,sockstate).

  * Various console/xml outputs tweaked to reflect this.

Nov 28 DEVEL_0_9_2_PRE2

  * Added a 16 entry per-host eventlog file in /var/state/n2/events that
    contains a fixed-size array of 16 elements with a timestamp, the
    old state, the new state and some explanatory text.

  * Tweaked console/xml output to include this log information.

  * Fixed a segmentation error in the init_info() handler.

Nov 27 DEVEL_0_9_2_PRE1

  * Cleaned up the state handling (added new states ST_STALE, ST_DEAD).
